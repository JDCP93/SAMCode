# First import the data (csv files stolen from De Kauwe - data is provided in 
# pdf form in Ogle 2015)

# Import the ANPP and precip partitioned by event data
ANPPandPrecip = read.table("data/dataset2.csv",

    # Note that these data are total annual precip (mm) 
    # partitioned into the size of the events that produced the precip:
    # Event1 = received in rain events with <5mm precip
    # Event2 = received in rain events with 5-15mm precip
    # Event3 = received in rain events with 15-30mm precip 
    # Event4 = received in rain events with >30mm precip
    # NPP is in g/m^2. It is actually the forage produced which in Lauenroth 
    # and Sala (1992) is shown to be linearly correlated with ANPP

# Import monthly precip data
