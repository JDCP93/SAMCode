# First import the data (csv files stolen from De Kauwe - data is provided in pdf form in Ogle 2015)

# Import the ANPP and precip partitioned by event data
ANPPandPrecip = read.table("data/dataset2.csv", header = TRUE, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
    # Note that these data are total annual precip (mm) partitioned into the size of the events that produced the precip
    # Event1 = received in rain events with <5mm precip
    # Event2 = received in rain events with 5-15mm precip
    # Event3 = received in rain events with 15-30mm precip 
    # Event4 = received in rain events with >30mm precip
    # NPP is in g/m^2. It is actually the forage produced which in Lauenroth and Sala (1992) is shown to be linearly correlated with ANPP

# Import monthly precip data
Precip = read.table("data/dataset3.csv", header = TRUE, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
    # This covers 91 years
    # Note the precip totals are in inches - the model converts this to mm

# Specify the investigated lag length and the assignment of months to time blocks
'Nlag'=5 # The number of previous years for which precipitation may affect current NPP
'block'= structure(.Data=c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, # Partition months into time blocks e.g. for month 10,11,12 in year 5, group them into time block 38
