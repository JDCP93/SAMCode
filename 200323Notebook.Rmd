# Introduction

This notebook is to track my work in the week commencing 23/03/20.

Following Zoom with Martin and Gab, the below are my targets for this week:

1. Take FLUXNET data from one site and test it OOS
 + Model NEE as function of precip, VPD and Temp
 + Run the SAM approach over a few years and then see how the model works for
 the following years
 + I could investigate whether the 3-6 model works for it at all.
2. Sort out working from home
3. Read and produce a "BIG" question along with some hypotheses to test within
this question's framework
