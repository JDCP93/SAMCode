# Introduction

This R Markdown Notebook replicates and expands on the work of Ogle et al in 
their 2015 paper.

# Model Construction

The below code is mostly a re-working of Appendix S2 from Ogle et al. 
The initial step was reproducing the model and results from the paper.
The below section details this.

First we call the model wrapper. The following inputs must be specified:

Datasets - the csv files that provide the ANPP and precip data
Nlag - the number of years for which antecedent precip is assumed to impact NPP
block - the the partitioning of the months into time blocks
Model run parameters - samples, burn, nadapt, nchain, thin
parameters - the parameters in the model that we want to track

```{r}

## Data Initialisation and Model Set Up

rm(list=ls()) # Clear workspace
graphics.off() # This closes all of R's graphics windows.
cat("\f") # Clear console

library(rstudioapi) # Source rstudioapi to set working directory as needed
library(rjags) # Source rjags for Bayesian analysis
library(ggplot2) # Source ggplot2 to plot results
library(gridExtra) # Source gridExtra for better plots

current_path <- getActiveDocumentContext()$path # Find location of this script
setwd(dirname(current_path )) # Set this to working directory


# First import the data (csv files stolen from De Kauwe - data is provided in 
# pdf form in Ogle 2015)

# Import the ANPP and precip partitioned by event data
ANPPandPrecip = read.table("data/dataset2.csv", 
                           header = TRUE, 
                           stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
    # Note that these data are total annual precip (mm) 
    # partitioned into the size of the events that produced the precip:
    # Event1 = received in rain events with <5mm precip
    # Event2 = received in rain events with 5-15mm precip
    # Event3 = received in rain events with 15-30mm precip 
    # Event4 = received in rain events with >30mm precip
    # NPP is in g/m^2. It is actually the forage produced which in Lauenroth 
    # and Sala (1992) is shown to be linearly correlated with ANPP

# Import monthly precip data
Precip = read.table("data/dataset3.csv", 
                    header = TRUE, 
                    stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
    # This covers 91 years
    # Note the precip totals are in inches - the model converts this to mm

# Specify the investigated lag length and the assignment of months to time 
# blocks
# # The number of previous years for which precipitation may affect current NPP
'Nlag'=5 
# Partition months into time blocks e.g. for month 10,11,12 in year 5, 
# group them into time block 38
'block'= matrix(c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 
                           16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 25, 26, 26, 
                           27, 27, 28, 28, 29, 29, 30, 30, 31, 31, 31, 32, 32, 
                           32, 33, 33, 33, 34, 34, 34, 35, 35, 35, 36, 36, 36, 
                           37, 37, 37, 38, 38, 38), 
                    nrow=Nlag,ncol=12,byrow = TRUE)

# Define the parameters for the model operation
# samples to be kept after burn in
samples <- 50000 
# iterations for burn in
burn <- samples * 0.1 
# number of iterations where samplers adapt behaviour to maximise efficiency
nadapt <- 100  
# The number of MCMC chains to run
nchains <- 4 
# thinning rate
# save every thin-th iteration to reduce correlation between 
# consecutive values in the chain
thin <- 10 

# Decide the variables to track
parameters = c('mu','a','weightOrdered','cum.weight','sumD1','weight') 

# Combine the data required for the model
Data = list('Nlag'=Nlag 
            ,'block'= block
            # number of years for which NPP and precip event data are available
            ,'N'=nrow(ANPPandPrecip) 
            # number of years for which monthly precipitation data is available
            ,'Nyrs'=nrow(Precip) 
            # number of time blocks the months are partitioned into
            ,'Nblocks'=max(block) 
            # Monthly precip data
            ,'ppt'=Precip[,-1] 
            # Year ID for NPP
            ,'YearID'=ANPPandPrecip$YearID 
            # Yearly precip event data
            ,'Event'=ANPPandPrecip[,c(4,5,6,7)] 
            # Yearly NPP data - comment this out to obtain the priors
#            ,'NPP'=ANPPandPrecip[,2] 
            )

# Put the model system into a variable
jags <- jags.model('Model.R', data=Data, n.chains=nchains, n.adapt=nadapt) 

```

Now we can run the model. Note, we might not need to if the output files already
exist!!

```{r}
# Generate the MCMC chain (this is basically running the Bayesian analysis)
fit <- coda.samples(jags, n.iter=samples, n.burnin=burn, thin=thin,
                    variable.names=parameters)

# Save the summary of the output as either the prior or posterior
# if NPP data isn't used in the model runs 
# then the output is the prior distributions
 if (length(Data$NPP)==0){ 
      priorSummary = summary(fit)
      save("priorSummary",file="priorSummary.Rdata")
 } else{ 
# NPP data is specified and the output is the posterior distributions
      posteriorSummary = summary(fit)
      save("posteriorSummary",file="posteriorSummary.Rdata")
   }
```

***

Now that we have modelled NPP based on precipitation using Bayesian methods, we
can perform some analysis to confirm that the model has behaved similarly to that
from Ogle et al (it should have done because we used their code!)

We now want to plot figure 2 from Ogle et al for the NPP model to compare our
results to theirs.

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(gridExtra)

# Yearly NPP data
NPPobserved=ANPPandPrecip[,2] 
  
# Load the prior and posterior data
load("priorSummary.RData")
load("posteriorSummary.Rdata")

# Create variables for the parameters of interest
priStats = data.frame(priorSummary$statistics)
priQntls = data.frame(priorSummary$quantiles)

priMu = priStats[grep("mu",row.names(priStats)),]
priA = priStats[grep("a",row.names(priStats)),]
priCum.weight = priStats[grep("cum.weight",row.names(priStats)),]
priCum.weightQntls = priQntls[grep("cum.weight",row.names(priQntls)),]
priSumD1 = priStats[grep("sumD1",row.names(priStats)),]
priSumD1Qntls = priQntls[grep("sumD1",row.names(priStats)),]

posStats = data.frame(posteriorSummary$statistics)
posQntls = data.frame(posteriorSummary$quantiles)

posMu = posStats[grep("mu",row.names(posStats)),]
posMuQntls = posQntls[grep("mu",row.names(posStats)),]
posA = posStats[grep("a",row.names(posStats)),]
posAQntls = posQntls[grep("a",row.names(posStats)),]
posCum.weight = posStats[grep("cum.weight",row.names(posStats)),]
posCum.weightQntls = posQntls[grep("cum.weight",row.names(posQntls)),]
posSumD1 = posStats[grep("sumD1",row.names(posStats)),]
posSumD1Qntls = posQntls[grep("sumD1",row.names(posStats)),]


# Create data frames for these variables to facilitate plotting  
posYearlyWeights = data.frame(YearIntoPast = 0:4, 
                              Weight = posSumD1$Mean/sum(posSumD1$Mean), 
                              min = posSumD1Qntls$X2.5./sum(posSumD1$Mean), 
                              max = posSumD1Qntls$X97.5./sum(posSumD1$Mean))
priYearlyWeights = data.frame(YearIntoPast = 0:4, 
                              Weight = priSumD1$Mean/sum(priSumD1$Mean), 
                              min = priSumD1Qntls$X2.5./sum(priSumD1$Mean), 
                              max = priSumD1Qntls$X97.5./sum(priSumD1$Mean))

# Define the corresponding variables for the alpha parameters
aDefinitions=factor(c("PPT","E_0-5","E_5-15","E_15-30","E_>30"),
                    levels=c("PPT","E_0-5","E_5-15","E_15-30","E_>30")) 

posYearlyA = data.frame(aDefinitions, 
                              Covariates = posA$Mean[2:6], 
                              min = posAQntls$X2.5.[2:6], 
                              max = posAQntls$X97.5.[2:6])

# Replicate the plot from Ogle et al 2015 
# for the alpha and yearly weight (page 227)
plot1 <- ggplot(posYearlyWeights,aes(YearIntoPast,
                                     Weight,
                                     ymin = min, 
                                     ymax = max)) + 
      geom_ribbon(data=priYearlyWeights,fill="grey70") +
      geom_line(data=priYearlyWeights) +
      geom_pointrange(data=posYearlyWeights) +
      ylim(0,1)

plot2 <- ggplot(posYearlyWeights,aes(aDefinitions,
                                     Covariates,
                                     ymin = min, 
                                     ymax = max)) + 
      geom_pointrange(data=posYearlyA)
 

grid.arrange(plot1, plot2, nrow = 1)

```

The right hand graph is very similar to Ogle et al - note that the scale of our
y axis is fixed while Ogle et al's changes at y=1.

The left hand graph is very similar to Ogle et al when looking at the posteriors
and also the mean of the priors. However, the credibility intervals (CI) for the
prior do not increase for years 3 and 4 as seen in Ogle et al. 

Ogle's lecture notes state that the 2.5 to 97.5 percentile specifies a CI which
is what is used here. I am unsure why Ogle's CIs expand and ours don't. 

***

We now plot the observed NPP against our modelled NPP

```{r}
# Plot modelled NPP against observed NPP

NPPobs = data.frame(Year=1:nrow(ANPPandPrecip)+1938,
                    NPP_obs = NPPobserved)
NPPmod = data.frame(Year=1:nrow(ANPPandPrecip)+1938,
                    NPP_mod = posMu[,1],
                    NPP_modmin = posMuQntls[,1],
                    NPP_modmax = posMuQntls[,5])

plot3 <- ggplot(NPPobs) +
  geom_line(data=NPPobs,aes(Year,NPP_obs),color='steelblue',size=3) +
  geom_point(data=NPPobs,aes(Year,NPP_obs),color='steelblue',size=3,na.rm=TRUE) +
         geom_line(data=NPPmod,aes(Year,NPP_mod)) +
         geom_pointrange(data=NPPmod,aes(Year,
                                         NPP_mod,
                                         ymin=NPP_modmin,
                                         ymax=NPP_modmax)) 



grid.arrange(plot3)
```
The blue line is the observed NPP. We can see that for the vast majority of years
the observed NPP falls within the CI of our model output. 2 years do not have 
observed NPP which is why we have gaps in the graph.


***

We also replicate figure 4a from Ogle et al. This is the cumulative monthly 
weights.

```{r}
posCum.weightdf = data.frame(monthInPast=1:nrow(posCum.weight),
                    CumulativeWeight = posCum.weight[,1],
                    min = posCum.weightQntls[,1],
                    max = posCum.weightQntls[,5])
priCum.weightdf = data.frame(monthInPast=1:nrow(priCum.weight),
                             CumulativeWeight = priCum.weight[,1],
                             min = priCum.weightQntls[,1],
                             max = priCum.weightQntls[,5])


plot4 <- ggplot(posCum.weightdf) +
      geom_ribbon(data=priCum.weightdf,
                  aes(monthInPast,ymin=min,ymax=max),
                  fill='grey70') +
      coord_cartesian(ylim=c(-0.015,1.015),xlim=c(0,60.5),expand = FALSE) +
      geom_vline(xintercept = 12,color='grey40') +
      geom_vline(xintercept = min(posCum.weightdf$monthInPast[posCum.weightdf$max>=0.9]),
                 color='grey40') +
      geom_vline(xintercept = min(posCum.weightdf$monthInPast[posCum.weightdf$CumulativeWeight>=0.9]),
                 linetype = 'dotted') +
      geom_pointrange(data=posCum.weightdf,aes(monthInPast,
                                          CumulativeWeight,
                                          ymin=min,
                                          ymax=max)) +
      geom_line(data=priCum.weightdf,aes(monthInPast, CumulativeWeight)) +
      geom_hline(yintercept = 0.9,
                 linetype = 'dashed') 


grid.arrange(plot4)
```
We can see how similar our plot is to that of Ogle et al's. 

Of note is that the weight where c = 0.9 is 3 months higher than Ogle's 
(53 vs 50) - therefore our result appears to show that the memory of precipitation
is longer. 
Additional the point at which c = 0.9 is first within the CI of a weight is 48 
for us, while Ogle has this at 42.

Combined with the mismatching priors in Figure 2, this is concerning.


*** 

A further check is calculating the R^2 value for our model, and compare this to
the value specified by Ogle et al of 0.75 (Table 1).

```{r}
# Calculate value of R2
RSS = sum((posMu[,1]-NPPobserved)^2,na.rm=TRUE)
TSS = sum((NPPobserved-mean(NPPobserved,na.rm=TRUE))^2,na.rm=TRUE)
R2=1-(RSS)/(TSS)
print(R2)
```
As we can see our result is very similar and it is unclear exactly how Ogle et al
calculated their R^2.

***
# Initial investigations

Now that the model is up and running, we can start investigating how changing
the lag or time blocking affects our results.

Two more basic model runs were produced - one with 5 year lag but 60 time blocks
(i.e. each month had a unique weight) and one with a 1 year lag and 12 time 
blocks.

Attempts to plot the results of modelled NPP vs observed are currently struggling
to offset the error bars for clarity...

Therefore, we shall just compare R2 values for now

```{r}
# # Define a function that loads our model output files since all outputs have the
# same variable name
loadRData = function(filename){
      load(filename)
      filename <- get(ls()[grep("Summary",ls())])
      }

#Load ANPP and Precip data and place into dataframe
ANPPandPrecip = read.table("data/dataset2.csv", header = TRUE, 
                           stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
NPPobserved=data.frame("Year" = 1:52+1938,"NPP"=ANPPandPrecip[,2])

RSS5.38 = sum((NPP5.38$mean-NPPobserved$NPP)^2,na.rm=TRUE)

RSS1.12 = sum((NPP1.12$mean-NPPobserved$NPP)^2,na.rm=TRUE)
TSS = sum((NPPobserved$NPP-mean(NPPobserved$NPP,na.rm=TRUE))^2,na.rm=TRUE)
R2_5.38=1-(RSS5.38)/(TSS)
R2_5.60=1-(RSS5.60)/(TSS)
R2_1.12=1-(RSS1.12)/(TSS)

print(paste("Lag of 5 years and 38 time blocks gives R2 = ", round(R2_5.38,3), sep = ""))
print(paste("Lag of 5 years and 60 time blocks gives R2 = ", round(R2_5.60,3), sep = ""))
print(paste("Lag of 1 year and 12 time blocks gives R2 = ", round(R2_1.12,3), sep = ""))
```

As can be seen, looking only at 1 year gives a substantially worse fit.
Meanwhile, having 60 timeblocks rather than 38 only marginally improves the fit
while dramatically increasing the model runtime. Calculating the DIC would 
probably show a significant preference for the 5.38 run.
